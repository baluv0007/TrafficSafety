    detailedInfo: {
      overview: 'Speed monitoring systems combine accurate radar technology with high-visibility LED displays to show drivers their current speed in real-time, encouraging compliance with posted speed limits and promoting safer driving behavior. Our systems utilize advanced Doppler radar technology that precisely measures vehicle speeds up to 200 km/h, displaying the information on large LED digits visible from hundreds of meters away. Research demonstrates that these visible speed displays significantly reduce average vehicle speeds and improve driver compliance, particularly effective in school zones, residential areas, and work zones where speed reduction is critical for safety. The systems feature data logging capabilities that record traffic speeds over time, providing valuable analytics for traffic studies and enforcement planning. Solar-powered operation with battery backup ensures continuous function without external power requirements. Optional wireless connectivity enables remote monitoring and data download, while customizable alert thresholds can trigger flashing displays or warning messages when excessive speeds are detected.',

Flat feet provide stability while enabling barriers to be stacked efficiently for transport and storage, with each unit weighing approximately 13kg for manageable manual handling. High-visibility powder-coated finishes in safety yellow or orange ensure barriers are clearly visible to pedestrians, reducing trip hazards. Optional reflective panels enhance nighttime visibility for 24-hour site operations. The anti-trip design features smooth, rounded edges and flat top rails that eliminate catch points.
